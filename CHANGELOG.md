# Changelog

## 0.1.3 (pre-release)

A big update: new look, a better player and search, account syncing, and fixes for live TV.

**New look**
- A redesigned Home, Search, Library, Extensions and Settings. *Continue watching* is now a row of posters with a progress bar and "S1 · E3 · 40 min left".
- Make it yours in Settings → Appearance: menu position (top, left, right, bottom), roundness of corners, poster size, spacing, background and interface size.
- One calm start-up screen that waits until the app is ready, instead of several loaders.
- One window title bar. When the window is maximized it hides and comes back when you touch the top edge.

**Search**
- Results show up as each extension answers. Extensions that are still searching show a placeholder, and the ones with no results are hidden.
- A calmer search page; the recent searches no longer jump around.

**Player**
- New controls: elapsed time, the bar and the length on one line; **Sources** and **Tracks** buttons at the top right; the source and picture size under the title.
- Subtitles move up while the controls are visible. Default subtitle size is 17 with a shadow.
- A source that was switched to after a failed one now starts playing by itself instead of waiting paused.
- Open any link in **VLC** or your browser (Settings → Player → Preferred video player).

**Live TV**
- Fixed live channels drifting out of sync or going into slow motion after you skip ahead (for example WILLOW). "Go live" brings you back to the live picture.

**Accounts and syncing**
- AniList, MyAnimeList and Simkl need an API client of your own: Settings → Accounts & security → **Sign-in keys** explains the three steps and shows the redirect address to use. After "Authorise" the browser now returns to the app by itself.
- Title pages have a **Tracking** card (status, score, episodes) and the episodes you watch are reported to the services you signed in to.
- Fixed the FebBox cookies not being saved after signing in (StreamPlay and CineStream).

**Updates**
- The app now also looks for a new version every few hours while it stays open (not during a video), not only at start.

**Removed**
- Torrent support and the settings that did nothing on Windows.

Known issues: some live channels may still stutter every few seconds on certain PCs (we could not reproduce it yet: tell us on Telegram if you see it). Sign-in to the tracker services is new in this build and has had little testing with real accounts.

## 0.1.1 (pre-release)

- Fixed live DASH channels (for example JIO TV) repeating the last two seconds after a while: the channel's manifest lags behind its segments, which made the player fetch and play the same segment several times in a row. Every segment is played once now.

## 0.1.0 (pre-release)

First public build of CloudStream for Windows: a native Windows 11 (Fluent) app on the CloudStream 4.8.0 engine.

- Browse, search and open titles through third-party extension repositories you add yourself (the app ships without extensions or content); library, downloads page, accounts, settings.
- Player on libmpv: HLS and DASH (including ClearKey protected live channels), audio and video track menus, subtitle search (OpenSubtitles and others) and subtitle style (font, size, colours, outline, background, position, saved for all videos).
- Live DASH channels with many audio languages (for example JIO TV in the CNC Verse repository) play and switch audio without freezing.
- Installer for the current user (no administrator rights), upgrades in place; portable folder build for developers.
- Update checker: looks for new releases of this repository (Settings > About), installs them with one click, can be switched off.

Known limits: the installer is not code-signed (SmartScreen may warn); Windows 10/11 64-bit only.
