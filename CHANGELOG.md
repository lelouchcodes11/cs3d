# Changelog

## 0.1.1 (pre-release)

- Fixed live DASH channels (for example JIO TV) repeating the last two seconds after a while: the channel's manifest lags behind its segments, which made the player fetch and play the same segment several times in a row. Every segment is played once now.

## 0.1.0 (pre-release)

First public build of CloudStream for Windows: a native Windows 11 (Fluent) app on the CloudStream 4.8.0 engine.

- Browse, search and open titles through third-party extension repositories you add yourself (the app ships without extensions or content); library, downloads page, accounts, settings.
- Player on libmpv: HLS and DASH (including ClearKey protected live channels), audio and video track menus, subtitle search (OpenSubtitles and others) and subtitle style (font, size, colours, outline, background, position, saved for all videos).
- Live DASH channels with many audio languages (for example JIO TV in the CNC Verse repository) play and switch audio without freezing.
- Installer for the current user (no administrator rights), upgrades in place; portable folder build for developers.
- Update checker: looks for new releases of this repository (Settings > About), installs them with one click, can be switched off.

Known limits: the installer is not code-signed (SmartScreen may warn); Windows 10/11 64-bit only.
